#Expense Tracker
---

A simple [AngularJS 2 web app](expense-tracker-web/README.md) with a [Loopback backend API](expense-tracker-api/README.md) that you can use to track expenses. 

See the following projects:
* [Front-end AngularJS 2 web application](expense-tracker-web/README.md) 
* [Backend Loopback API](expense-tracker-api/README.md)

**CURRENTLY A WIP**

This project was started as a learning experience for me to get familiar with Angular.js, and I welcome anyone else in the web development community to play with it :)

Expenses Tracker is currenlty hosted on AWS at the following URL [http://54.174.89.133](http://54.174.89.133). The API Explorer is available at the following URL [http://54.174.89.133/explorer/](http://54.174.89.133/explorer/).

For testing, you can use the following users:

| email | password |
| --- | --- |
| admin1@example.com | admin1 |
| admin2@example.com | admin2 |
| test1@example.com | test1 |
| ... | ... |
| test8@example.com | test8 |

 (see [create-sample-model.js](server/boot/create-sample-model.js)
