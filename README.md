#Expense Tracker
---

A simple [AngularJS 2 web app](expense-tracker-web/README.md) with a [Loopback backend API](expense-tracker-api/README.md) that you can use to track expenses. 

See the following projects:
* [Front-end AngularJS 2 web application](expense-tracker-web/README.md) 
* [Backend Loopback API](expense-tracker-api/README.md)

**CURRENTLY A WIP**

This project was started as a learning experience for me to get familiar with Angular.js, and I welcome anyone else in the web development community to play with it :)
